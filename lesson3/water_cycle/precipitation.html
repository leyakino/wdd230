        <p>Overall, the Columbidae tend to have short legs, short bills with a fleshy cere, and small heads on large,
            compact bodies. In a series of experiments in 1975 by Dr. Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their
            characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It
            was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr. Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills;
            it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant. The wings are large,
            and have eleven primary feathers, and low wing loading; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles
            comprise 31–44% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds. They are also highly
            manoeuvrable in flight.</p>
